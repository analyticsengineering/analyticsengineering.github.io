An excellent blogpost by Sepideh Jahangiri and Philip Laserstein on One Big
Table vs. Dimensional Modeling for Information Marts:
<https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/one-big-table-vs-dimensional-modeling-on-databricks-sql-755fc3ef5dfd>

The blogpost is geared towards Databricks, but applies to Snowflake,
Redshift and Google BigQuery as well.
