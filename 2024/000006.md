*Tue Mar 5 21:16:50 UTC 2024*  

Snowflake now supports short-circuiting of queries when limit 0 is
specified. See:
<https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/performance-improvements-2024>

This reduces execution time for queries that use a count of 0 with LIMIT,
which is often used by applications to return column headings and data
types for query results.
