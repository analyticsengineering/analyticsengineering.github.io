Data Metrics Functions (DMF) are here! DMFs allow you to automate data
quality validation and monitoring in Snowflake. Snowflake has several
Pre-defined DMFs like NULL\_COUNT, DUPLICATE\_COUNT, UNIQUE\_COUNT, FRESHNESS,
ROW\_COUNT. If you need something more advanced, you can roll your own
custom Data Metric Functions. Creating custom DMFs is as easy as creating
UDFs and then attaching them to tables as follows. Sample SQL available on
GitHub:
