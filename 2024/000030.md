Snowflake now supports GREATEST\_IGNORE\_NULLS and LEAST\_IGNORE\_NULLS. In the
past if you used LEAST or GREATEST on a list of expressions that contained
NULL these functions always returned NULL, which was very problematic. You
had to do something like COALESCE(GREATEST(BILL\_DATE, SHIP\_DATE),
SHIP\_DATE, BILL\_DATE) to correctly handle NULLs. This was cumbersome. Now
you can simply use GREATEST\_IGNORE\_NULLS or LEAST\_IGNORE\_NULLS as following:

SQL Query:
select
 order\_number
 , greatest\_ignore\_nulls(bill\_date, ship\_date)
 as last\_activity\_date
from orders\_fact;
