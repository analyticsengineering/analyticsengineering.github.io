*Mon Apr 1 13:37:21 UTC 2024*  

I am looking for a way to define and manage Snowflake Tag-based masking
policies on columns in DBT. I found the following two packages:
<https://hub.getdbt.com/entechlog/dbt_snow_mask/latest/>
<https://dbt-tags.iflambda.com/latest/> by Infinite Lambda

Any experiences using either of these? Feedback? Thoughts?


Thanks,
Saqib
