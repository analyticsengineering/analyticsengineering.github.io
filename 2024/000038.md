Data Cleanrooms are now available in BigQuery. Data cleanrooms allow secure
and privacy-policy enforced sharing of data to 3rd parties:

While the concept of the Data Cleanroom has been available in Snowflake for

looks interesting. I will be trying it out over the next few weeks and will
share my experiences.
