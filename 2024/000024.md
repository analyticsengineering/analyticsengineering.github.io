Recently I started implementing DBT Contracts on models where the integrity
of the data is crucial. One thing to note is that before you start
enforcing DBT Contracts, ensure that you are ready for Model Versioning in
your environment. Any breaking changes e.g. removing a column or removing
the not\_null constraint on a column or changing the data type on a column
will require a new version of the model to be created. The good thing is
that DBT supports Model Versioning, and specification can be defined in the
YML file.
