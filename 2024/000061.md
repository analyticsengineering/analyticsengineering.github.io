*Wed May 8 17:08:32 UTC 2024*  

Today Snowflake added support for the ANY keyword or a SUBQUERY in the
PIVOT IN-list. This is a huge time-saver. You longer have to hard-code the
values for the PIVOT column. Sample data and Query available in github:
<https://qosf.com/snowflake-support-for-ANY-keyword-in-the-PIVOT-IN-list.html>

I know that support for using a SUBQUERY in the IN-list has been around in
Oracle and Teradata for a while, but support for the ANY Keyword is unique
to Snowflake as far as I know (correct me if I am wrong).
