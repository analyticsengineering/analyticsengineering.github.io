Google recently added a new Table Function called RANGE\_SESSIONIZE to
Google BigQuery. RANGE\_SESSIONIZE allows you to sessionize temporal data.
Timestamps from events that either meet or overlap form one session. I am
using it to sessionize web site visits and the pages viewed in each
session. Here is the sample query and data:

Looks interesting. I will post more as I discover more use cases for
RANGE\_SESSIONIZE .
