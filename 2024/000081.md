Another excellent blogpost on Snowflake Data Metric Functions (DMF) by
Peter Beck:
<https://medium.com/snowflake/monitoring-data-quality-using-snowflake-data-metric-functions-6b04229c6597>

Couple of interesting insights from the article:

 1. Snowflake runs DMFs under a warehouse it creates on your behalf. You
 are billed for this consumption under a special “Data Quality Monitoring”
 section of your bill. This enables you to see immediately what the costs
 associated with this kind of activity are. You can also query
 DATA\_QUALITY\_MONITORING\_USAGE\_HISTORY to see your consumption.
 2. Scheduling of DMFs is simple, and you don’t need to build your own
 target table to store the results.
