*Thu Mar 7 04:23:44 UTC 2024*  

Google BigQuery now supports GROUP BY ALL clause. This clause infers groups
by excluding:

1) expressions that are aggregate functions e.g. avg(), sum()
2) expressions that are windowing functions. e.g. COUNT(\*) OVER ()

Support for GROUP BY ALL was also added to Snowflake late last year. I have
been using it quite frequently in Snowflake, especially for adhoc
exploratory queries. It makes writing exploratory queries a lot faster.
