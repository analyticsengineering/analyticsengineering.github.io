<PRE>Estimating the cost of each SQL query in Snowflake is a challenge. I have
been struggling with this a lot lately. A tiny query could be running as
part of a Large Warehouse that is already up and running a complicated
query. How much does the tiny query cost? Is it better to run it separately
on a Xsmall Warehouse? Or more cost efficient if it runs on the Large
Warehouse that is already up and running. Snowflake does not do this
automatically, nor does it provide tools to get insights into this.

Miguel Duarte recently blogged about Accurately estimating the costs of
each SQL statement in Snowflake
<A HREF="https://miguelduarte.medium.com/reduce-your-snowflake-costs-by-accurately-estimating-the-costs-of-each-sql-statement-b65f5143402f">https://miguelduarte.medium.com/reduce-your-snowflake-costs-by-accurately-estimating-the-costs-of-each-sql-statement-b65f5143402f</A>

I haven't tried it out, but I'm planning to spend some time on this.

Thanks Miguel Duarte for putting this together.
