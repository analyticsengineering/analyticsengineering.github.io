# What is Analytics Engineering

Analytics engineering is an emerging discipline that combines principles and practices from software engineering, data engineering, and data analytics. The goal of analytics engineering is to increase the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of data analytics by applying software engineering best practices to the data analytics process.

Some key aspects of analytics engineering include:


## Data Modeling
From [Conceptual Modelling](what-is-the-difference-between-logical-modelling-and-conceptual-modelling-and-physical-modelling.md#conceptual-modeling) to Logical Modelling to Physical Modelling. Designing and implementing data models that support efficient data storage, retrieval, and analysis.

## Data Pipelines
Developing robust and scalable data pipelines to transform Raw Data from various sources into Modelled Data to create a unified data platform for analysis.

## Data Quality 
Implementing processes and tools to monitor and ensure the quality, consistency, and integrity of data throughout its lifecycle. Applying software testing methodologies and monitoring tools to data pipelines and analytics processes to ensure reliability and catch issues early.

## Productionization
Packaging and deploying data analytics solutions as reusable, scalable, and maintainable products or services.
   
## Collaboration
Facilitating collaboration between data engineers, data scientists, and other stakeholders to streamline the data analytics workflow.

The goal of analytics engineering is to bridge the gap between ad-hoc data analysis and production-ready data analytics systems, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions more efficiently and at scale.
