## Conceptual Modeling
- Focuses on capturing the high-level concepts, entities, relationships and processes as it relates to business.
- Represents the real-world entities, attributes, and relationships relevant to the business, independent of any specific implementation details.
- Uses concepts and notations that are closer to the business language and terminologies, such as Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams or UML class diagrams.
- Provides a shared understanding of the domain among stakeholders, developers, and end-users.
- Serves as a foundation for the logical and physical design phases.

## Logical Modeling
- Focuses on representing the structure and constraints of data required for a specific implementation, such as a database or software system.
- Defines the logical data structures, relationships, and integrity constraints based on the conceptual model.
- Incorporates implementation-specific details and design decisions, such as data types, primary keys, foreign keys, grain, and normalization rules.
- Uses more technical terminology and concepts related to the target implementation platform or technology.
- Commonly uses techniques like relational data models, object-oriented models, or dimensional models (for data warehouses).
- Serves as a blueprint for the physical implementation of databases, software applications, or other systems.

## Physical Modeling
- Focuses on the actual implementation details and technical specifications required to create the physical database or system. 
- Represents the physical storage structures, file organizations, indexing mechanisms, and access paths for data. For e.g. in case of a Data Vault, this will involve defining the HUB, LINKs, Satellites.
- Incorporates low-level details specific to the database management system (DBMS) or platform being used, such as table spaces, partitioning schemes, and storage parameters.
- Considers performance optimization techniques, such as indexing strategies, clustering, and denormalization.
- Serves as the final blueprint for creating and deploying the actual database or system implementation.

In summary, conceptual modeling captures the high-level domain concepts, logical modeling defines the logical data structures and constraints based on the conceptual model, and physical modeling specifies the low-level implementation details and technical configurations for the actual deployment of the database or system.

The progression from conceptual to logical to physical modeling ensures a systematic and structured approach to system design, facilitating communication, maintainability, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements or technologies.
